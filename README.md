# ABFlatTheme
ArchBang Flat Theme is a suite for Openbox, Tint2 and Dmenu.

It uses a slightly modified [Numix](https://github.com/shimmerproject/Numix) theme, compatible with Openbox, Gnome, Unity and XFCE.

It's a nice combination of dark elements, orange highlights and flat style.

Also includes [Ultra Flat Remix icon set](http://the-ilife.com/post/127)

For better integration and fast deployment, includes a tint2 configuration and dmenu-bind.sh color matching.
