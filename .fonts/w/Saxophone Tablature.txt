Woodwind Tablature - Saxophone - Euro
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Key Caps information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The tablature system used in this font has been based upon that outlined
by Jean-Marie Londeix in his book, "HELLO!  Mr. SAX".

The symbols and keys used on the tablature will automatically place
themselves in the correct place if they are entered as one 'unit', e.g.

     `vTj will give:

     8va
       o
       o
       o
      ---
   Ta  o
       o
       o


Basic Keys:
^^^^^^^^^^^
Press ` (i.e. the key with the ~) to get the blank tablature, then press
the numbers to 'fill in' the holes.

           o   <- 1
           o   <- 2
           o   <- 3
          ---
           o   <- 4
           o   <- 5
           o   <- 6

Press shift+number to get 1/2 holes.

Press option+number (Macintosh only) to get shaded holes (/).

Other Keys:
^^^^^^^^^^^
v or 8 = 8va
x = front key
P or p = P
. = . between holes 1 & 2

b = B to the right of the tablature
B = Bb to the right of the tablature
G = G# to the right of the tablature
C = C# to the right of the tablature

D = D# below the tablature
E = Eb below the tablature
c = C below the tablature
+ = D#+C below the tablature

T = T
j = a (as in Ta)
k = c (as in Tc)
l = f (as in Tf)

A = A to the left of the tablature

q = C1
w = C2
e = C3
r = C4
t = C5

f = F at the upper right of the tablature

b = B to the right of the tablature (keys in the middle of the sax)
B = Bb to the right of the tablature
G = G# to the right of the tablature
C = C# to the right of the tablature

e = E to the left of the tablature
r = C to the left of the tablature

This font is interchangable with the font - WoodwindTablatureSaxGraphic.
 This means that you can enter the enter keystrokes in one font, and
simply and change font to the other, keeping the same fingering.
